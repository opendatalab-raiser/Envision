        "explanation": "This frame establishes the initial state. In zero gravity, the droplet's potential energy is uniform. The dominant force is surface tension, an effect of intermolecular cohesion, which minimizes surface area, resulting in a perfect sphere. The system is in equilibrium, with internal pressure balanced by surface tension forces (Laplace pressure: ΔP = 2γ/R)."

The net force (gravity component minus tension) causes tangential acceleration, increasing its velocity.

This energy transfer, primarily through conduction, provides the latent heat of fusion (Q = mL) required to break the ice's crystalline bonds. This initiates the phase change from solid to liquid.

The rate of potential energy loss accelerates as the orbital radius shrinks dramatically.

        "explanation": "This establishes the initial state. The gyroscope possesses a large angular momentum (L) directed vertically. Due to its rapid spin, this angular momentum vector is stable. The force of gravity (mg) acts downwards through the center of mass, and the normal force from the pivot acts upwards. Since these forces are collinear, there is no net torque (τ = r x F = 0) on the gyroscope."

The vertical orientation is now slightly tilted, and a slow circular motion has started.",

The top is about to fall completely.",

By pulling their arms inward, the person decreases their moment of inertia (I_f < I_i) by reducing the mass distribution radius (r).

By extending their arms, the person increases their moment of inertia back to the initial value (I_f ≈ I_i).
