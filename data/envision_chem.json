        "explanation": "The BZ reaction begins its auto-catalytic cycle. Malonic acid starts to reduce the yellow cerium(IV) catalyst to colorless cerium(III). Simultaneously, ferroin indicator reacts with bromate ions, forming blue-purple ferroin oxide, which nucleates as patches. This is the start of the oscillating color change."

The blue-purple ferroin oxide patches have rapidly expanded, dominating the solution's color. Cerium(IV) is almost entirely reduced to colorless cerium(III). The solution is now a deep blue-purple, with small remaining yellow-orange areas shrinking as the reaction wave propagates.",
        "explanation": "The auto-catalytic production of bromous acid (HBrO2) drives the rapid oxidation of the ferroin indicator, causing the blue-purple color to spread. This wave propagation is a hallmark of the BZ reaction, demonstrating a non-linear chemical oscillator."

The entire solution has returned to its initial red color as the ferroin indicator is reduced back to its Fe(II) state. Bubbles of carbon dioxide are visible throughout the solution.",
        "explanation": "The final stage shows the reduction of the ferroin indicator from Fe(III) (blue) back to Fe(II) (red) by malonic acid. This completes the cycle. The decarboxylation of bromomalonic acid produces CO2 gas."

The mixture is at room temperature, ready for reaction.",
        "explanation": "This frame establishes the initial state. The reactants are benzene (aromatic substrate), acetyl chloride (acylating agent), and aluminum chloride (Lewis acid catalyst). The Lewis acid is required to activate the acetyl chloride for electrophilic aromatic substitution."

The benzene molecule is poised to attack this electrophile. The solution begins to show slight turbidity as the complex forms.",
