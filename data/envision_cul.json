        "prompt": "This is the second event frame of a continuous four-stage event progression showing rural Ohio as early electric lines are installed and workers erect wooden poles near existing telegraph infrastructure.",
        "explanation": "This frame captures the initial stage of electrification in rural Ohio, showing workers actively installing electric poles, symbolizing the early impact of Edison's innovations. The addition of electric lines marks the beginning of the technological transformation, visibly altering the foreground while the background—fields, barns, and landscape—remains unchanged to emphasize causality and progression."

        "explanation": "This frame illustrates the tangible effects of electrification in rural Ohio. From the same fixed viewpoint, we now see electric lights in use, a radio indicating access to mass communication, and changes in daily life. The background remains constant—fields, barns, and landscape—while the foreground shows families enjoying new amenities."
