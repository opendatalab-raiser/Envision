The ocean is calm with small, regular waves lapping the shore.",

This undercutting destabilizes the cliff above, initiating mass movement (slumping). The fixed viewpoint emphasizes the direct cause-and-effect relationship between wave energy and the initial stages of cliff retreat.

This hard rock armor protects the loose tephra from erosion. The island expands laterally.",

As the river enters the standing water, its velocity decreases, and the coarsest sediment particles (sands and gravels) are the first to be deposited.

The pressure from the volatile-rich magma has catastrophically exceeded the strength of the overlying rock, resulting in a powerful explosive eruption.

The sand surface is dry and loose, ready to be moved by the wind.",

The key causal factors are a plentiful supply of dry sand, a persistent onshore wind providing transport energy, and pioneer vegetation acting as an initial obstacle.

A new, active lobe is now building out elsewhere.",

The glacier's absence leaves behind classic landforms: a U-shaped valley, a terminal moraine acting as a natural dam, and a large proglacial lake. A new fluvial system has established itself, reworking glacial sediments. Advanced primary succession indicates ecological recovery on the newly exposed land."

The rock is dark basalt, still steaming slightly, with no signs of soil or life. The surrounding sea is clear blue, and the sky is bright.",
        "explanation": "This scene establishes the initial conditions for primary succession. A volcanic eruption has created new land (a sterile substrate) from cooled lava. This barren island represents a blank slate, devoid of soil and biological organisms, ready for colonization by pioneer species."

Tiny patches of green and grey dot the otherwise black, sterile lava flow. The new land is no longer completely devoid of life, showing the first signs of biological activity.",
        "explanation": "This step illustrates the arrival and establishment of pioneer species. These organisms are adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Through chemical weathering, they begin the slow process of breaking down the parent rock, which is the crucial first stage of soil formation (pedogenesis)."

These intermediate species further stabilize the nascent soil, increase moisture retention, and outcompete the earlier lichens and mosses.",
        "explanation": "This frame illustrates ecological succession. The decomposition of pioneer species creates the first true soil, enabling intermediate species like grasses to establish. Their root systems bind the soil, preventing erosion and adding more organic matter. This process, known as facilitation, alters the environment, making it more suitable for later-successional species."

Heavy orographic rainfall is visible, with dense, unmodified temperate rainforest covering the slopes down to the rocky shoreline. The ocean is turbulent at the base of the cliffs.",
        "explanation": "This scene establishes the initial conditions for mass wasting. Tectonic uplift creates steep, gravitationally unstable slopes. Intense orographic precipitation saturates the soil and weathered bedrock, reducing its shear strength and cohesion. This sets the stage for a landslide."

The viewpoint is fixed offshore, looking at the mountainside from the sea.",
        "explanation": "Increased pore water pressure from persistent rainfall has overcome the frictional resistance of the soil and weathered rock.

The camera is fixed offshore, capturing the dramatic collapse from an unchanging viewpoint.",
        "explanation": "The slope has failed catastrophically. The saturated material moves as a coherent slump along a curved slip plane, driven by gravity. This rapid mass movement drastically reshapes the coastal profile, transporting huge volumes of sediment into the marine environment."

        "explanation": "This scene establishes the initial conditions for glacial retreat. The valley glacier, a product of long-term snow accumulation and compaction, has carved the U-shaped valley through erosion. Moraines are deposits of till transported by the ice. This represents a state of glacial maximum or equilibrium before a climatic shift initiates melting."

Meltwater streams are now visible on the glacier's surface and pooling at its base, initiating the formation of a proglacial lake.",
        "explanation": "This step shows the initial response to climatic warming. Increased ablation (melting) exceeds accumulation, causing the glacier's mass balance to become negative. The glacier thins and its terminus retreats from the previously deposited terminal moraine. Meltwater begins to rework glacial sediments and collect in depressions, initiating fluvioglacial and lacustrine processes."

Braided meltwater streams, heavy with sediment, carve new channels through the exposed valley floor. Sparse pioneer vegetation begins to colonize the oldest moraines.",
        "explanation": "This step depicts advanced deglaciation. Continued negative mass balance causes rapid retreat, unveiling the glacially-sculpted landscape. Meltwater-fed proglacial lakes enlarge and fluvioglacial braided rivers become dominant agents of erosion and deposition on the valley floor. Primary succession starts on the most stable, long-exposed ground."

The valley sides are extensively colonized by climax vegetation like conifer forests, with only the highest peaks remaining as bare rock arêtes.",
        "explanation": "This final stage illustrates the post-glacial equilibrium. The glacier's disappearance reveals classic erosional features like a U-shaped valley and arêtes. Fluvial systems have matured from braided to meandering, and a stable ribbon lake has formed. Ecological succession has progressed to a climax community, stabilizing the landscape. The perspective is unchanged, completing the long-term causal sequence."

The heaviest sediment particles (bedload) are deposited first, forming submerged sandbars and distributary mouth bars just beyond the river's mouth. The water becomes cloudy with suspended load.",
        "explanation": "As the river enters the standing sea water, its velocity and energy decrease sharply. This loss of competence causes the coarsest sediment (sand and gravel) to be deposited first. These initial deposits form submerged bars at the river mouth, which are the foundational structures of the growing delta. The finer particles remain suspended, creating turbid water."

Vegetation is colonizing these new, stable landforms.",
        "explanation": "As deposition continues, submerged bars build up vertically and emerge above the water level. The main river channel is choked with sediment, forcing it to bifurcate into smaller, less efficient distributary channels. This process, called avulsion, builds the classic fan-shaped delta lobe. Pioneer vegetation colonizes the newly created, stable land, further stabilizing the deposits."

The main river channel has been abandoned, and new sub-deltas are forming at the mouths of the active distributaries. The original coastline is now far inland.",
